## Setup Development Environment

You can set up your development environment using one of the following methods:

### Using Dev Containers (Recommended)

This project includes a pre-configured development environment using [VSCode Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

1. **Install Docker**: [Download and Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
2. **Install VSCode**: [Download and Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. **Install the Remote Development Extension**: Install the [Remote Development extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).
4. **Open the repository within the container**:

   Open the repository in VSCode and select `Reopen in Container` to use the pre-configured DevContainer environment.

   All necessary tools are pre-installed and configured.

### Running Locally

If you prefer to run the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). To install the correct Node.js version, consider using [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - To install the project dependencies.

## Quick Start

```sh
# Install the correct version of Node.js
# and install the project dependencies
fnm use
pnpm install

# Generate a .env.local file using Sanity
pnpm run setup

# Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

## Development Workflow

For most development work, you'll primarily use `pnpm run dev`. However, you have additional scripts at your disposal for various tasks:

| pnpm run <script>  | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`      | Starts the local development server for building and previewing your application.                   |
| `npm run format`   | Formats the codebase using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure consistent code styling.      |
| `npm run lint`     | Runs linting on the codebase to identify and report on patterns with [eslint](https://eslint.org/). |
| `npm run lint:fix` | Automatically fixes linting errors in the codebase where possible.                                  |

## Production

Scripts for preparing and viewing the production version:

| pnpm run <script> | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run start`   | Serves your application using the production setup, ensuring it's ready for deployment.      |
| `npm run build`   | Compiles the application into the `dist/` directory, preparing it for production deployment. |
